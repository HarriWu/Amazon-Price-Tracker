# Amazon Price Tracker

App checks product price on Amazon and if that price falls below your desired price for that product an email will be sent as a reminder. The app uses an excel file to hold all of the products and your set price for them. Each product will be checked and a daily report will be sent via email of the product prices that have met the desired price that you set.

## How It Works

Uses openpyxl to extract all information regarding sender email, receiver email, user-agent, products and their desired prices from excel file. Uses BeautifulSoup to scrape Amazon for the product price. Compiles report based on comparing product price with desired price and sends out report daily to the receiver email address.
